Hi im David
i wrote this great desing book, where i tell ppl
that pressing save is bad, just let the user
handel all input like it where a real notepad
so i want all my forms to save when the
user somehow leaves the page

$('form').protect_data(autoSubmit=true) 
is what i want..

and for my next ajax project i need
$('form').protect_data(autoSubmit=true, ajax=true)
