Hi im robert!

i build this framework, where every page is loaded by ajax
the problem is, when a user clicks another link he will loose his work
so i need a plugin that stops ajax requests and asks
if a user has changed form data

so i need
$('form').protect_data('ajax'=>true)

and i want to make requests, that dont change the 
formdata, so i have to deactivate it too

buttonClick(){
  $.protect_data.unprotect(2);
  load();
  load();
}
