Hi im Micha
im building a email application, and when the from was
submitted via ajax, i want the user to see a small
"data is save" tag to appear and to disable the submit button
until the users changes something again

And if the user edits a form i also want to highlite a small
you have unsaved changes box

this functionality should go into a callback

$('form').protectData({stateChangeCallback:function(isProtected){
  if(isProtected)alert("relax your save");
}})
